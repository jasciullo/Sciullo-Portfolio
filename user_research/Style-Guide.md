The goal of this style guide is to establish a clear, consistent, and unique visual identity for the NASA SBIR/STTR website. It is based on the [NASA Style Guide](https://elibrary.gsfc.nasa.gov/_assets/doclibBidder/tech_docs/NASA%20Style%20Guide%20-%20Full%20Guide%20-%20Copy.pdf) with additions and modifications where needed for the SBIR/STTR use case.

essential component of NASA’s communication strategy.  

Buildings / machinery: images should evoke what is exciting / innovative about the subject.
