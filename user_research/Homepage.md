# Apply for NASA's small business seed fund, and you might help us build the next-generation rover, predict weather patterns, or conduct planetary fly-bys.

The United States of America is home to some of the world’s best technological innovators.  Without you, it's harder for us to fulfill our mission.  You can help us get there, all while supporting the prosperity and security of our country.

Our seed fund is specifically built for small businesses, and helps stimulate technological creativity and innovation by partnering you with NASA scientists conducting cutting edge research.  We are focused on increasing the commercialization of work funded through this program in the private sector, which helps create viable, sustainable small businesses for the future.  Socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses are especially encouraged to apply. 

#The NASA Advantage

The NASA seed fund provides:
- Equity-free funding
- Reduced risk and expense of R&D efforts
- More level playing field with big business
- Coaching and mentoring
- High visibility

###I'd rather be exploring space.
Working with NASA is unlike any other experience an entrepreneur will have.  From world-class laboratories and facilities to missions destined to capture the imagination, NASA’s seed fund gives you unparalleled benefits over a typical incubator.  Besides developing technology that may support the future exploration of space, you’re also supporting the United State’s prosperity and security through this prestigious program.  

###Equity-free funding.
NASA seed funds are provided “equity-free”.  The intellectual property rights, including ownership of data, copyrights and inventions are protected.  And, your proprietary data is protected under the contract for four years.  Furthermore, your work for NASA may assist you in finding other funding opportunities, both inside and outside government.  

###Help and coaching along the way.
Debriefings and technical evaluations will also help you build the best solution possible.

#Guidelines

If your company is a U.S. company operating in the United States, majority-owned and controlled by U.S. citizens or permanent residents, and has 500 or less employees, you may qualify.  Your Principal Investigator (generally the individual responsible for leading and conducting a significant portion of the work) needs to be primarily employed by the company, equivalent to more that 50% of the PI’s work time.  

If you are a non-profit research institute in a university or research laboratory, you may also be eligible to participate through our technology transfer program.

Don't have a company yet but still want to participate?  Here's a step-by-step process you can follow to set up a company to do business with the government. 

#Getting started

The NASA seed fund supports entrepreneurs by providing seed funding for research and development (R&D) and demonstration of new, innovative technology that supports NASA’s mission.  

1. Apply
2. If awarded, up to $125,000 for the first phase (Phase I - 6 months). 
3. Companies that successfully complete Phase I are encouraged to apply for a second round of funding, and apply for Phase II.
4. If awarded, up to $750,000 for the second phase (Phase II - 2 years).
5. Successful companies that complete Phase II pursue commercialization in the private sector through a variety of activities, and can also apply for follow-on funding through other government initiatives.  You can learn more about those opportunities, including the extended Phase II program, the Commercialization Readiness Program and available matching funds here.

#Tips for submitting a winning application

NASA evaluates proposals based on:

* Scientific/Technical Merit and Feasibility.  
* Experience, Qualifications and Facilities. 
* Effectiveness of the Proposed Work Plan.  
* Commercial Potential and Feasibility
* Price Reasonableness

A good Phase I proposal should (1) describe the proposed innovation relative to the state of the art; (2) address the scientific, technical and commercial merit and feasibility of the proposed innovation and its relevance and significance to one or more NASA needs within a subtopic of the Solicitation and (3) provide a preliminary strategy that addresses key technical, market, business factors pertinent to the successful development, demonstration of the proposed innovation, and its transition into products and services for NASA mission programs and other potential customers.

In other words, projects that are well planned and understood, fulfill a need identified by NASA and are likely to grow into viable commercial products are good candidates for the program.  Just like any other business, NASA expects that applicants understand their market and product viability and are prepared to put in the hard work to make it a success.
