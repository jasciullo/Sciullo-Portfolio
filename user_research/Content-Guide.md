# Introduction

Welcome to the xxx content guide! This short, informal guide offers strategies for writing content that will appeal to NASA’s diverse group of users. 

The intent of this guide is to provide unbiased recommendations on plain language / industry-standard language to attract and retain high level participants for the SBIR / STTR program, and provide guidelines for writing more inclusive content. 

As is the case with all 18F projects, this project adheres to the principles outlined in the [18F content guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/). In cases where a topic isn’t addressed by our internal guide, we defer to the guidelines set out by the [AP Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/).
 
# Background

While conducting user research and a service blueprint for this project, we identified key messaging themes that current and future participants seemed to want to understand about the NASA SBIR / STTR program.  At a high level, they were: 

* **How do I know who to work with?** Participants spoke to us about preparing to apply for an award very early. For many people, their first steps included finding the right team to do the work and the right match for their company or expertise in a solicitation topic.

* **How do I decide to apply?  How do I apply and win?**  Participants spoke to us about how they decided to apply for SBIR/STTR funding. Not all considerations are monetary, but most small businesses deeply consider the necessarily time investment to apply versus the expected payout (and chances of winning).

* **How do I grow my business?**  Participants spoke to us about the challenges of running a successful small business. For many of them, their expertise is in developing new technology, not necessarily in business acumen.

During our content audit, we also learned a few things about the current site: 

* There is a lot of information on the website, and most of it does not appear to address needs uncovered during user research. This makes it difficult for users to find the right information quickly.
* There is some great content already there, but it is a bit hidden right now.
* Standardization of content and design should aid in the flow of information. 
* NASA is cool — people want to work with NASA. The website should excite people about pitching to NASA and accurately inform them about their chances of winning (which may be higher than they think).
* NASA should feel (and be) approachable. The application process and timeline should be easy to read and understand.

# Voice and tone 

When we think about communicating the value and intent of the NASA SBIR / STTR program, we first and foremost want to ensure we are communicating clarity, competence, and authority.  But we also want the content to be approachable, friendly, and trustworthy.  In order to do this effectively, it is helpful to consider guidelines that help avoid content that might otherwise isolate or frustrate the reader, while highlighting content that answers the most pressing questions the reader might have in a voice that will resonate with them.  

For government websites, this may mean avoiding the use of acronyms or jargon that are familiar to us as federal employees but not to the general public.  For example, the vast majority of entrepreneurs that have never worked with government before will not know what an SBIR program is.  Language and writing that helps them quickly understand the intent of the program and whether or not they qualify is fundamentally critical to attracting more applicants. 

For example, we might consider describing the NASA SBIR / STTR program this way: 

> NASA supports entrepreneurs by providing seed funding for research and development (R&D) and demonstration of new, innovative technology that supports NASA’s mission.

We might also want to communicate the unique value proposition of working with NASA’s small business program: 

> Working with NASA is unlike any other experience an entrepreneur will have. From world-class laboratories and facilities to missions destined to capture the imagination, NASA’s seed fund gives you unparalleled benefits over a typical incubator. 

As well as how working with NASA helps serve the greater good of the country: 

> Besides developing technology that may support the future exploration of space, you’re also supporting the United State’s prosperity and security through this prestigious program.

The voice for public-facing NASA SBIR / STTR content should be:

* Friendly and welcoming but not too casual 
* Authoritative but not patronizing 
* Serious but not stuffy
* Precise (regarding language choices) but not overly academic
* Welcoming to all audiences 

For tone, public-facing NASA SBIR / STTR content should be:

* Instructive
* Enthusiastic
* Encouraging
* Exciting

In some senses, this site is a marketing site, hoping to attract the attention of as many qualified grant applicants as possible; for this reason, (tempered) enthusiasm is warranted. 

# Keep it simple
Grant applicants, many of whom are entrepreneurs, have limited time to browse this site. For this reason — and to more generally follow content-writing best practices — we should aim to keep our content as concise as possible.

As you’re writing, try to:

## Avoid redundancy 
Only present information as often as you have to. Think carefully before publishing information multiple times, considering the benefits (and drawbacks) of duplicative publication. Publishing the same information in multiple places increases the likelihood of introducing errors; it can also cause user confusion, and it makes content maintenance harder. 

## Keep sentences and paragraphs short
If you find yourself with an unwieldy sentence, consider whether it might be better divided into two sentences. Keep paragraphs tightly focused on a single idea or theme.

##Use contractions
Not only do they help create a friendly tone, but they also help keep sentences shorter!

#Connecting with users

Creating a more positive user experience — in other words, really connecting with your users — can drive engagement. Writing content that uses the brand voice/tone certainly helps this effort. Another connection strategy is to address the user as you instead of in the third person. Using you mimics actual conversations and feels friendlier (less distant) than the third person alternative.
 
#Conscious style
18F follows the [Conscious Style Guide](http://consciousstyleguide.com/) to be inclusive of all users. Our content guide has more [detailed guidance on following conscious style](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/conscious-style/), and we encourage you to check it out. Key tips to bear mind include:

* Avoid using gendered pronouns (use they instead).
Use the public, users, people, or folks instead of citizens (wherever possible); not all folks who use government services or engage with federal agencies are U.S. citizens, and it’s important to acknowledge this fact.
* Avoid age-related descriptions of folks unless they’re absolutely necessary to the content. And, in cases where age descriptors are necessary, using older person instead of elderly or senior.

#Capitalization 
Use sentence case for titles, headings, page titles, and so on. Sentence case is easier to scan than title case, which promotes a piece of content’s readability. 

Capitalize proper nouns, but do not capitalize personal titles unless they precede a name.

Finally, we don’t capitalize federal or government.
