## Background

Although the infectious disease of measles was declared erradicated from the US in xxxx -2019 saw a surge in confirmed cases of measles in several states. As of October 2019 the number of reported cases slowed down and we were able to keep our erracted status. Worldwide - the WHO lists vaccine hestiancy as one of the top ten global threats. Since global travel of US citizens (in/out of the country) continues and as do individuals/commounities who may be vaccine hesitant - there is a threat to the public health of people residing in the US.
