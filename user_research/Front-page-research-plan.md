Goals | Questions
:----- | :---------
Evaluate front page | Do people unfamiliar with the program understand what the site is about?
 | What is confusing, if anything?
Prioritize what to fix | What problems are most severe?

## Background

NASA SBIR/STTR spoke its customers about their experience interacting with their program and created a service blueprint. One of the outcomes of this research was that efforts to streamline and template the initial application process and clarify NASA SBIR/STTR statistics and program goals would likely be very effective in increasing participation, especially from non-traditional groups. NASA SBIR/STTR should also leverage the NASA brand as a selling point.

This is the first test of a homepage mockup with NASA SBIR/STTR program information written in plain language.

### Metrics

* Whether participants understand what the site is about
* Whether participants seem engaged/excited to learn more and click into content

## Methods
* 10-15 min interviews people who are unfamiliar with NASA SBIR/STTR
* Notes
* Remote or in-person
