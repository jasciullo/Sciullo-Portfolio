# TSWD Final Project user research script


## Introductory comments

"Hello my name is Jennifer Sciullo and I am a Heinz College graduate student. I'm currently working on my final project for the course 'Telling Stories with Data'". 

“My goal today is to get feedback on data visualizations that I am proposing for my final project. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. All feedback is anonymous, and this review should take less than 15 minutes of your time.”

“Please remember when I say ‘review’ I mean I’m reviewing select data visualizations to determine if they are clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!”

## Main section

Ask: **What’s your job? What do you do?**

"The data visualizations are shown on this laptop. Imagine you were reading an article or blog post online and this data visualization was included in the story. If you could, please note anything that you find confusing. This can include text, data elements, or data points. Next, please note anything that makes sense to you and that you would like more information about. Finally, please note anything you are not interested in/want to see less of."

As they work through the page: Ask follow-up questions as necessary, encourage partipcants to follow their own process (i.e. it’s fine for them to do one read-through before they start making notes), and respond to any questions with further discussion.

1. "OK. First of all, can you tell me (in your own words) what you think this data visualization is about?"

1. "Who do you think the intended audience is for this data visualization?" or "Who do you think this data visualization is for?"

1. "What other questions do you have about this data visualization, if any?"

## Wrap-up

“Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions for me?”
