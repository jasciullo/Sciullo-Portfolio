# Front page content testing script


## Introductory comments

Brief introduction – share your name and a description of your role at 18F.

Very brief discussion of the purpose of today’s test: “My goal today is to get feedback on a new page we're designing. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. All feedback is anonymous, and the test should take less than 10 minutes of your time.”

“Please remember when I say ‘test’ I mean I’m testing our website and if it is clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!”


## Main section

Ask: **What’s your job? What do you do?**

"I’ve got a printed version of the front page here. Imagine somebody sent you a link to this site and this is what popped up in front of you when you clicked on the link. If you could, please put a question mark next to anything (word, phrase, section, prompt) that you find confusing. Put a plus sign next to anything that makes sense to you and that you'd like more information about. Finally, draw a minus sign next to anything you're not interested in/want to see less of."

As they work through the page: Ask follow-up questions as necessary, encourage them to follow their own process (i.e. it’s fine for them to do one read-through before they start highlighting), and respond to any questions with further discussion.

1. "OK. First of all, can you tell me (in your own words) what you think this site is for?"

1. "Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?" or "Who do you think this site is for?"

1. "What other questions do you have about this site, if any?"



## Wrap-up

“Thank you so much for your time. Do you have any questions for me?”
