# Data visualization user research script


## Introductory comments

"Hello my name is Jennifer Sciullo and I am a Heinz College graduate student. I'm currently taking the course 'Telling Stories with Data'". 

“My goal today is to get feedback on a data visualzatio project that I am working on. I’m talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. All feedback is anonymous, and this review should take less than 10 minutes of your time.”

“Please remember when I say ‘review’ I mean I’m reviewing select data visualizations to determine if they are clear or not. There are no wrong answers for you!”


## Main section

Ask: **What’s your job? What do you do?**

"I’ve got a printed version of the data visualizations here. Imagine you were reading an article and this data visualization was included. If you could, please put a question mark next to anything (word, data element, or data point) that you find confusing. Put a plus sign next to anything that makes sense to you and that you'd like more information about. Finally, draw a minus sign next to anything you're not interested in/want to see less of."

As they work through the page: Ask follow-up questions as necessary, encourage them to follow their own process (i.e. it’s fine for them to do one read-through before they start highlighting), and respond to any questions with further discussion.

## Wrap-up
