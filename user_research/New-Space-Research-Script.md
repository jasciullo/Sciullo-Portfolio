## Introduction

Thank you so much for taking time out of your day to participate in this interview. My name is [state your name] and I work for a part of General Services Administration called 18F that provides technology and design services to other parts of government. Today, I’m joined by [name] from the NASA Small Business Innovation Research program. 
 
Our goal today is to hear about you understand about public-funded or government-funded innovation. We'd also like to get feedback on NASA's Small Business Innovation Research and Technology Transfer programs. We're talking to people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing about the programs. If you haven't heard of these programs before, that's okay. We'd like to hear about that, too. All feedback is anonymous, and the interview should take about 15-20 minutes of your time. There are no wrong or right answers and you won't hurt our feelings.
 
First, here's a consent form for you to sign. The purpose of this form is to tell you that this study is voluntary and that will we protect the information that you provide us. Please let us know if you have concerns at any time during the interview or if you'd like it to stop. 

Thank you. Do you have any questions before we get started?
