## New Space Conference research plan
The NASA and 18F teams are attending the New Space conference in San Francisco, CA. While we are there, we will conduct user research to learn more about how NASA programs can support small businesses.

### Background

In late 2016 and early 2017, the 18F team spoke to NASA SBIR and STTR participants about their experiences with the programs. Most of our interviewees were already familiar with the program and or had participated before. We did not have a chance to learn from prospective participants unfamiliar with the program. We hope this conference will provide an opportunity to talk to folks in this group. Through 1:1 interviews and a facilitated group activity, we want to learn more about the barriers to applying to the NASA SBIR and STTR programs, and how NASA might improve the program to meet user needs.


### Schedule 
Wednesday, June 28: 
- Ad-hoc 1:1 Interviews using similar, open ended questions from Workshop, or earlier questions from our research (Jamie / Alex)
- Public-funded Innovation Panel featuring Jenn @ 4:15 PM - 5:15 PM
- 1:1s with participants, 5:30 PM - 6:30 PM 

Thursday, June 29: facilitated workshop activity from 12pm - 1:30 pm

### Overarching research questions and guiding prompts:  
1. What are participants' current thoughts about government funding for small businesses and entrepreneurs?
2. What do potential program participants need and want from a government funded program?  Why?
3. What do participants know about the NASA SBIR and STTR programs?  What would they change?

### Facilitators
18F: Chris Goranson, Jamie Albrecht  
NASA: Jenn Gustetic, Dan Carpenter, and Alex Budz

### Participants
Companies and investors that:
* Have little to know knowledge of the government funding, especially the SBIR and STTR programs, 
* Have some exposure to government funding and or the program, but have not considered applying,
* Have not successfully participated in the SBIR and STTR programs previously, or
* Did not respond to the recent NASA request for information  

### Metrics

* Whether participants understand what the pilot program is about 
* Whether participants seem engaged and excited to learn more
* Whether participants seem willing to participate

### Methods

#### Method #1: [interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/#stakeholder-and-user-interviews) with potential program participants attending the New Space Conference

Goals | Questions 
:----- | :---------
Capture awareness of the SBIR/STTR program  | Have you heard about NASA's Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs? If yes, can you tell me more about it? If no, what questions do you have?
Capture interest in pursuing NASA funding | Knowing what you now know about the program, what would you do next? Why? What do you want to know more about? What concerns do you have? 
Capture insights into the competitiveness of the program | How do you decide what funding to pursue? How do you see the NASA opportunity factoring into that decision? Why?


### Materials
* Pen and paper to take notes
* Printouts of 1-page prototype (Jamie)
* Service blueprint or document of the proposed pilot program?
* One-page explanation of the program (Jenn / Alex)
* Consent forms

## Script
* [New Space 1:1 script](https://github.com/18F/NASA-SBIR-STTR/wiki/New-Space-Research-Script)

#### Method #2: facilitated exercise with potential program participants
Overarching goal: identify innovative ways to improve the NASA SBIR-STTR program using the [KJ Method](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/kj-method/). 

Goals | Prompts 
:----- | :---------
Understand the perception of government funding, and NASA funding in particular | **Write down at least three things you know about how the federal government interacts with small businesses.**
Understand what participants would want to see as part of a government-funded program, and why |  **Write down three things you'd like to see in a NASA program that supports small businesses.**
Identify key characteristics or messaging themes that we could change right now for the SBIR-STTR program | Here are some characteristics of the current SBIR / STTR program [sharing either things verbally, printed, or written].  **What interests you?  What would you like to know more about?  What is confusing or doesn't make sense to you? What questions do you have?**

### Materials
* Markers
* Poster paper
* Sticky notes

### Format

Setup: Place sticky notes and markers on each table.  Place large poster paper sheets on the walls. One poster for each of the three prompts and one titled "parking lot".  

Introduction: Jenn sets the stage for the workshop, what NASA hopes to learn, and introduces the 18F team.  Chris introduces the format of the workshop. 

# Prompt #1 (15 - 20 minutes total): In the next three minutes, write down at least three things you know about how the federal government interacts with small businesses.

Chris introduces the first prompt. Jamie, Jenn, Alex, and Dan distribute themselves throughout the room to repeat the prompt and answer questions from participants as they arise. We will address questions related to the activity, but other topics should be collected for the parking lot. 

## 3 Minutes
**In the next three minutes, write down at least three things you know about how the federal government interacts with small businesses.** Participants should do this individually.   

# 7 minutes
After three minutes, participants should take the next 7 minutes to share their thoughts as a group at their table. Encourage participants to group similar stickies together in themes.  

# 7 minutes
When tables are ready, each table should also nominate someone to quickly present and  the stickies and organize into themes on the sticky paper. 

Facilitators stand around the room to help participants add stickies to the wall and group items into similar themes.  Chris / Jamie organize stickies with volunteers into themes. 

**At the end of the 15 minutes, Jamie introduces the next prompt.**

# Prompt #2: In the next three minutes, write down three things you'd like to see in a NASA program that supports small businesses.

**At the end of 15 minutes, Jamie turns it over to Jenn, who introduces the third and final prompt, and presentation.**  

# Prompt #3: Here are some characteristics of the current SBIR and STTR programs [sharing either things verbally, printed, or written]. What interests or strikes you most?  What would you like to know more about?  What is confusing or doesn't make sense to you?  

Let's use a Townhall format: a presentation, attendees write down questions / concerns, and Jenn responds to questions after the presentation. 

_Note: for Prompt #3, what is the one most important question we're hoping to answer here?_  (flagged for Jenn / Alex)

**Take the next 30 minutes to discuss.** Jenn facilitates the conversation and Chris takes notes. The rest of the facilitators contribute to the conversation. 

After 30 minutes, Jenn ends the activity, and thanks everyone for their time. She shares:
* What we will do with this information

Jenn closes the workshop with next steps including:
* What to expect from the results
* Other ways to get involved
* How to follow up

## Appendix

### What to do if there are too many participants for the room size
* See if the participant is willing to do a 1:1 with NASA during the conference
* Give them a way to get in touch with NASA after the event (bring business cards, printed prompts from the workshop)

### Backup activity: 
* A [card sorting](https://methods.18f.gov/validate/card-sorting/) exercise to identify key ingredients of a future pilot project.

### Time
