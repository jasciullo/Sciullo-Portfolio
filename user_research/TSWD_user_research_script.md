# TSWD Final Project user research script

Greetings!

Hello my name is Jennifer Sciullo and I am a Heinz College graduate student. I'm currently working on my final project for the course “Telling Stories with Data”.

My goal today is to get feedback on data visualizations that I am proposing for my final project which examines measles data for the US. I’m gathering information from people to see what makes sense and what’s confusing. This review should take less than 15 minutes of your time.

Please note there are no wrong answers!

Data Visualizations:

The data visualizations are found here. For each visualization, imagine you are reading an article or blog post and these data visualizations are included in the story. If you could, please note anything that you find confusing. This can include text, data elements, or data points. Next, please note anything that makes sense to you and that you would like more information about. Finally, please note anything you are not interested in/want to see less of.

You should free free to follow your own process. For each visualization, be sure to include:

What you think this data visualization is about.

Who you think the intended audience is for this data visualization. Or, who do you think this data visualization is for.

Additional questions you have about the data visualization.

Thank you so much for your time. Let me know you have any questions!

Jennifer
