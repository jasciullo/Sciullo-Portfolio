## Data Visualization #1 

User A:

1. Data visualization is showing number of measles cases reported per year in the US. There have been no cases in Pennsylvania in the nine years prior to 2019 but several cases were seen this year. There are a lot more cases of measles reported in 2019 in general.
2. Intended audience: Someone with a minimum of basic knowledge in the field of public health wanting to know if people still get measles in the US. 
3. Additional questions:
    • These are total cases in the US? I'm assuming so based on context in your instructions and the fact that the data is from the CDC. Not seeing this noted on image. 
    • How do other states compare to PA?
    • Why are there so many more cases of measles reported in 2019 compared to the prior nine years?
    • What do years prior to 2010 look like? Are there noticeable trends if looking at a large sample size of years?
    • As 2019 is not over, how much of the year does this data include?
    • Are all cases of measles reported? Should consideration be given for non-reported cases? Are there known issues with under reporting?

User B:

This visualization is about the number of reported measles cases per year and is likely intended to show the spike in measles cases in 2019, drawing attention to the first instances of measles in Pennsylvania. I would assume this visualization is for people interested in disease prevention and management, such as researchers, scientists, and doctors, specifically pediatricians. Parents would have a vested interested in this study as well. I find this visualization easy to read and understand.

User C:

This appears to be the number of measles cases reported by year for the past 9 years.  From 2010-2018 the data suggest that there were no recorded cases of the measles- is that true?  I would like to see the n= for the # of cases in PA too. The audience could be the general population- I would place this at an 8th grade level of understanding.

## Data Visualization #2 

User A:

1. Data visualization is showing trend of MMR vaccinations from 1995-2017 as a comparison between recommended rate, national rate and rate in Pennsylvania. The national rate consistently falls below the recommended rate, as does the PA rate in most years. PA tends to trend slightly above the national rate with the exception of a few years, most notably 2012.
2. Intended audience: Someone with a minimum of basic knowledge in the field of public health wanting to know how the US and PA specifically compare to the recommended MMR vaccination rate.
3. Additional questions:
    • Why is the PA rate so low in 2012?
    • What impact has/will the low rate in 2012 have on occurrence of measles in PA?
    • Why is there more potential error in the vaccination rate shown for PA versus the national rate?
    • I'm assuming it is recommended that MMR vaccinations be given between 19 and 35 months of age. Is this vaccination often given outside of this range?
      
User B:

This visualization is comparing the national MMR vaccination rate with the vaccination rate in PA, compared to the recommended vaccination rate. Due to the inclusion of error ranges I would assume this visualization is intended for an audience more familiar with statistics. I found the similarity in the colors of the data to be a bit confusing.

User C:

The MMR Vaccination Trends from the National MMR Vaccination Rate, PA MMR Vaccination Rate and the Recommended MMR Vaccination rate are provided amount children 19-35 months.  The presentation of these data was not fully digestible.  It might be an issue with the colors chosen for the graph, but it's unclear what the shaded areas on either side of the plotted line represent.  I think we are missing one plotted line, no?  The audience for this slide might be a conference.

## Data Visualization #3 

User A:

1. Seems very similar to the data in the last visualization, just presented differently. The data visualization is showing trend of MMR vaccinations from 1995-2017 as a comparison first between PA and the national average, then between PA and the recommended rate. With the exception of a few years, PA generally trends above the national rate but falls below the recommended rate.
2. Intended audience: Someone with a minimum of basic knowledge in the field of public health wanting to know how PA specifically compares to the national average rate and recommended MMR vaccination rate.
3. Additional questions:
    • Is this data for a specific age group?
    • Why the drop in 2012? (Image #2 makes the drop in 2012 seem a lot more dramatic than this one. I'm not sure that I necessarily would have asked this if I hadn't just seen the last visualization).
    • How does the rest of the US compare to the recommended rate? I can see this much more clearly in the previous image. This one does lead me to the conclusion that if PA is usually above the national average but below the recommended rate then the rest of the US must be below the PA rate.
    • Even though I feel like I'm looking at similar data to what I saw previously, this one is making me now want to know more about why the US is below the recommended rate and what PA has done to generally trend higher than other states. Are there lessons to be learned from PA vaccination programs that could generally improve the national rate? Does the PA and national rate need improving? Are the current rates that bad? What do other developed countries' rates look like?
    • Also definitely starting to connect the dots with how vaccination rate may impact occurrence of a disease. I know from the first image that PA recently saw cases of measles for the first time in nine years. Could this have been tied to the drop in vaccination rate in 2012? At what age do people get measles? If you told me age seven I would definitely start to form a connection. Isn't age seven right about the time when kids are entering school full-time? (Ok not a question on the visualizations but is half day kindergarten still a thing? Because I honestly don't know. I have no children and really no reason to know this information. But it was a thing when I was five years old...well over three decades ago).  

User B:

This one took me longer to understand than the previous ones. I think the previous visualization did a much better job of getting the same point across. The difference in scale between the two visualizations threw me off. I believe this visualization would be for the same target value as visualization 2.

User C:

The data presented appear to be the same as the previous slide, just presented a little differently.  It appears as if PA did a great job in vaccinating their children in all but 2009, 2012 and 2015 as compared to the national average.  That being said, PA failed to meet the target of 95% (per recommendations), save for the years 2001 and 2004.  I like this depiction of the data- I think the heading on the right graph could benefit from the following clarification, "Recommended MMR Vaccination Rate (95%)".  The audience for this could be a mix of the general public and academia.

## Data Visualization #4 

User A:

1. Is showing percentage of MMR vaccination rates in Lehigh Valley Schools. There are more high rates than low rates but I am surprised to see so many low rates.
2. Intended audience: Residents of the Lehigh Valley area who care about getting measles - so parents of young children, elderly, those with compromised immune systems; perhaps making a case for parents to vaccinate their children.
3. Additional questions:
    • Where in PA were the cases of measles reported in 2019? Were they in the Lehigh Valley area? 
    • What do rates in the rest of the state look like?
    • Why are some schools in this area showing low rates? What are the primary reasons for children not receiving the MMR vaccination? Is there some connection between this reasoning and this particular area? (ie. vaccination requirements, availability of vaccine, socioeconomic status, religious beliefs)

User B:

This visualization seems to be aimed at parents, showing them the MMR vaccination ranges of schools in the Lehigh area. This visualization would be much more useful if hovering over a marker would give you the name of a school. Just as I typed that I noticed the link to the interactive map. Now I find this visualization very useful, especially since you can scroll through a list where schools are clearly grouped in relation to their vaccination rate. If I wanted to make sure to send my child to a school with a high MMR vaccination rate, this would be an incredibly useful resource for me.

User C:

This is a depiction of specific rates of MMR vaccinations in Eastern PA.  It's difficult to discern the geopoints as the colors are all very similar, but I think you could use these data (or a similar presentation of these data) to inform municipalities about their specific MMR vaccination rates- its also unclear what year this is from.  These data are the least useful IMHO.
