# About me

![Profile Image](sciullo_profile.jpg)

Greetings wild ones! My name is Jennifer Sciullo. I go by the pronouns she/her/hers. I'm a part-time MPM student at the Heinz College. A native of Pittsburgh, I enjoy exploring the rivers, hills, and valleys that I call home. My background includes work in higher education, arts management, and business development for drug and alcohol treatment centers. I currently work with alumni, faculty, and students as the alumni coordinator for the Graduate School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh.

# What I hope to learn
I'm excited to learn more about the methods and vocabulary used to critique data. I am also thrilled to learn new techniques that will help bring life to the data in my world. The readings, exercises, and lectures that are outlined for this course will be useful in my current position. I hope to leave this course with a solid foundation in the field of data visualization. Upon graduation I hope to advance my career in higher education administration, as I continue to build my knowledge base related to the design, critique, and execution of good data.
