# Greetings wild ones

My name is Jennifer Sciullo. I go by the pronouns she/her/hers. I'm a part-time MPM student at the Heinz College. A native of Pittsburgh, I enjoy exploring the rivers, hills, and valleys that I call home. My background includes work in higher education, arts management, and business development. I currently work with alumni, faculty, and students as the alumni coordinator for the Graduate School of Public Health at the University of Pittsburgh.


# What I learned

Telling Stories with Data provided an engaging and challenging opportunity to learn more about the art and science of data visualization.  I found the lectures and courseworse to be helpful as I critiqued, designed, and redesigned various assignments. Upon graduation I hope to advance my career in higher education administration, telling good stories (including ones with data) along the way.
