![Profile Image](profile_image.jpg)

Greetings wild ones! My name is Jennifer Sciullo. I go by the pronouns she/her/hers. I'm an MPM student at the Heinz College. A native of Pittsburgh, I enjoy exploring the rivers, hills, and valleys that I call home. 

# What I hope to learn
I'm excited to learn more about the methods/vocabulary used to critique data. I am also thrilled to learn new techniques that will help bring life to the data in my world. Upon graduation I hope to advance my career in higher education administration.
