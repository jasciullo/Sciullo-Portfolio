# Final Data Story


## Audience

My project targets two distinct audiences. 


The first are individuals that I refer to as vaccination fence-sitters. These are people who are not staunchly opposed to routine vaccinations, but may be questioning the safety and side effects (short-term and long-term) about vaccinations. Alternatively they may feel that the issue is simply unimportant, and that as long as they are immunized then they are protected and the choices of others don’t directly impact them. They may live in a particular community that has active and/or vocal members who may use manipulated data or anecdotal  evidence to support the case for not vaccinating oneself or others.


The second audience for my presentation are individuals who support vaccination in their communities and are interested in the public health implications of vaccination rates in the US and in their backyard. Sharing information, resources, and suggested best practices with this audience has the potential to reach fence-sitters in their social network.


Both audiences can benefit from concise and non-threatening concepts about herd immunity and timely information about vaccination rates in their community and the US. They should both be informed of the importance and impact of maintaining and improving vaccination rates.


## Work

I found it challenging to work with multiple data sets that don’t necessarily play nice with one another (I’m looking at you CDC!) or that are poorly sourced and with broken links (news outlets seem peculiarly bad about this). A further challenge was fleshing out the topic into manageable pieces. I wanted to drive home the concept of herd immunity and how just a small dip in vaccination rates in PA can lead to big differences in the potential for a measles outbreak. This design decision was driven by my identified target audiences.


I continued to sketch data visualizations throughout the process of my project. I found this to be a helpful way to start organizing my thoughts on paper. These exercises helped me to narrow down what story I was trying to tell and what graphic tool would be best.


At first it was rough identifying the raw data that I needed for my project. Several sites referenced government data sources, but did not have an easy way of extracting the actual data. I successfully found a couple of data sets that were helpful in focusing my story and then the real work began! Co-temporalizing. Matching data sets. Data gymnastics.


## Observations

Communicating the importance of vaccinations is a challenging endeavor. It’s easy to forget about the diseases that are considered eradicated in our developed country because of widespread vaccination in the US. Additionally, public health professionals and clinicians are challenged with communicating evidence-based science in the 2019 geo-political landscape.


That said, my research yielded some interesting information about communicating with vaccination fence-sitters. This population was shown to be more likely to be influenced in a positive direction toward vaccine acceptance when they were educated about the concept of herd immunity in relation to social responsibility. I am interested in doing additional research related to this in relation to public health decisions that people make.


## Design decisions made

I aimed to keep things simple, clear, and concise.


For the overall cases of measles reported I used a horizontal bar chart to illustrate the dramatic rise in US cases reported for 2019.


The CDC data that I mined for PA vaccination rates was a time intensive endeavor. I used a line graph, and trend chart to show how PA fared in relation to the recommended vaccination coverage and national vaccination coverage. This line graph is effective at illustrating the rates through time at a cursory level, but the view of the data is not terribly “kinetic”.  To improve the dynamic visual range and to help illustrate the trends of PA data, I also provided arrow charts for this data.


The interactive county map designed via Tableau helps to illustrate the counties in PA that are at risk for potential outbreak. I find it interesting that a state can rank at the accepted percentage to be considered to have herd immunity (achieving a vaccination rate in the population of 95% or greater) but individual counties can be lower.


I ended up pulling back from a lengthy description about the signs, symptoms, and ways measles is contracted. I also omitted a timeline for the disease - including key points in vaccine history - to focus on why vaccination against measles is an important public health issue for everyone. I work with a number of public health professionals, so when asking for user feedback on my designs I went outside of this network to obtain an alternate perspective on how I was telling my story through data.
