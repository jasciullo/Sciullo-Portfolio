# Final Project

## Project Name

**Vaccine Hesitancy and the Resurgence of Measles in the US**

## Other Stakeholders and their Roles

Pitt Public Health colleagues, Allegheny County Health Department employees, Telling Stories with Data classmates

## Project Summary

I intend to examine the increase in reported cases of measles in the US and how vaccine hesitancy has played a role.
This project is timely since the number of reported cases of measles in the US spiked in 2019 – with a record number of cases
reported in PA [1](#1) (including cases in Allegheny County, PA) [2](#2) Since vaccination exemption is set by each state [3](#3) – it’s crucial to understand how state government exemptions for vaccines affect the public health of citizens in our region.

Why examine measles specifically? [4](#4)? High virulence makes it a good indicator for overall vaccination rates.

## Project Structure

### Present the timeline of reported cases of measles, as well as demographic patterns of distribution

Current data on measles – US/PA. Who is affected? [5](#5)

CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks – 2019 US [6](#6)

**Morbidity:**

Reported number of new measles (rubeola) cases: 120 (2017)

Reported number of new mumps cases: 6,109 (2017)

Reported number of new German measles (rubella) cases: 7 (2017)

### Present statistics on vaccination, and vaccination policy

Percent of children aged 19-35 months vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella: 91.5% (2017)

Percent of adolescents aged 13-17 years vaccinated against measles, mumps, rubella (2 doses or more): 92.1% (2017)

**Recommended Vaccine Schedule** [11](#11)

**Vaccine Exemptions** [16](#16)

### Vaccine hesitancy and herd immunity

**Effect on herd immunity** [12](#12), [13](#13)

**Vaccine hesitancy** [17](#17),[18](#18)

**Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System**

Data sets from 1990 – 2019

Domestic and Non-domestic [10](#10)

### Show current tools for modelling epidemics and demonstrate the importance of vaccination

**Projection – Project Tycho** [14](#14)

**FRED** [15](#15)

FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) is an agent-based modeling system for
simulating the spatial and temporal patterns of epidemics. FRED was developed by the Public Health
Dynamics Laboratory in the Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh.

This page shows possible outbreaks following the introduction of a single measles case in selected
US cities. The model shows the importance of a high vaccination rate in providing protection for
the entire community.

## Key dates & Final Deadline

Final presentation: 2019-12-04

## Challenges

* Identifying target audience and framing story arc accordingly
* Blending disparate sources of data.
* Finding a creative way to bring value to an ongoing conversation about the subject of the rise of vaccine hesitancy and the resurgence of highly communicable and deadly diseases. In large part due to the great effectiveness of past vaccination campaigns, in this country we have lately had very little conversation about the importance of vaccination and the suffering it ended. A narrative of vaccine hesitancy has arisen and occupies an out-sized portion of the framing discussion regarding vaccines. The modern ubiquity of data and accessibility to it has been a boon to research, but it is also being mis-used and mis-represented to support the anti-vaccination narrative. 

## Measuring Success

Possibly including short survey after project review to address understanding of vaccination, its history, and its benefits.
