# Final Project

## Project Name

**Vaccine Hesitancy and the Resurgence of Measles in the US**

## Other Stakeholders and their Roles

Pitt Public Health colleagues, Allegheny County Health Department employees, Telling Stories with Data classmates

## Project Summary

Examination of the increase in reported cases of measles in US and how vaccine hesitancy has played a role.
Timely topic because The number of reported cases of meases spiked in 2019 – with a record number of cases
reported (ex. X). PA [1](#1) (and specifically Allegheny County) [2](#2) –  reported cases. And vaccine hesitancy public
health issue. Since vaccination exemption is set by each state [3](#3) – it’s important to know how this affects
our public health in region.

Why measles [4](#4)? Very contagious – shows overall vaccination rates for region.

**FRED** [15](#15)

FRED (A Framework for Reconstructing Epidemiological Dynamics) is an agent-based modeling system for
simulating the spatial and temporal patterns of epidemics. FRED was developed by the Public Health
Dynamics Laboratory in the Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh.

This page shows possible outbreaks following the introduction of a single measles case in selected
US cities. The model shows the importance of a high vaccination rate in providing protection for
the entire community.
